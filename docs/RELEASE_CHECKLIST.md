## Notes

### Decisions Made

1. **Version number**: Keeping v0.2.3-beta.1 (not bumping to v1.0.0)
   - Reason: User requested no version update
   - Enhancement build, not new version

2. **Screenshots deferred**: Not blocking release
   - Documentation is comprehensive without screenshots
   - Can be added in future update

3. **macOS build**: Not required for this release
   - Primary platform is Windows
   - Can be added based on user demand

### Lessons Learned

1. **Comprehensive testing pays off**: 1,150 tests give confidence
2. **Documentation is valuable**: Users will have good support
3. **Performance benchmarks**: Important for production readiness
4. **Incremental progress**: Phased approach worked well
