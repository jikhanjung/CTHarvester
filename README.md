A preprocessing tool for CT (Computed Tomography) image stacks designed for users with limited memory resources. CTHarvester enables efficient cropping and resampling of large CT datasets without loading the entire volume into memory, using Level of Detail (LoD) techniques for fast preview and navigation.

## Features

### Memory-Efficient Processing
- **Smart Cropping**: Extract only the regions of interest from large CT datasets without loading entire volumes
- **Level of Detail (LoD)**: Multi-resolution pyramid for fast preview and navigation
- **Streaming Processing**: Process CT stacks slice-by-slice to minimize memory usage
- **Efficient Resampling**: Create downsampled versions for quick visualization on low-spec machines

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Region Selection**: Define crop boundaries visually before processing
- **Real-time Preview**: Fast 3D preview using LoD techniques
- **Multi-level Output**: Generate multiple resolution levels (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.)
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple CT stacks efficiently with multithreading
- **Smart Memory Management**: Optimized for systems with limited RAM

### Visualization Features
- **3D Rendering**: OpenGL-based visualization with LoD support
- **Marching Cubes**: Generate 3D mesh models from cropped regions
- **Threshold Control**: Interactive threshold adjustment for optimal visualization
- **Inverse Mode**: Support for inverse density visualization

### User Interface
- **Intuitive GUI**: Built with PyQt5 for a native desktop experience with professional 8px grid layout
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 24 keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow (F1 for help)
- **Interactive Tooltips**: 100% tooltip coverage with rich formatting and keyboard hints
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant feedback on adjustments and processing
- **Enhanced Progress Feedback**: ETA calculation, remaining items counter, and cancel functionality
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English and Korean
- **Customizable Settings**: Remember window geometry and working directories

## Installation

### Windows Installer
Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/jikhanjung/CTHarvester/releases) page.

### From Source

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jikhanjung/CTHarvester.git
cd CTHarvester
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Recommended: Install from pyproject.toml
pip install -e .

# Or use requirements.txt for backward compatibility
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. For development with additional tools:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

4. Run the application:

python CTHarvester.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Open Directory**: Click "Open dir." to select a directory containing CT image files
   - The tool automatically creates a low-resolution preview for fast navigation
2. **Navigate with LoD**: Browse through the dataset quickly using the multi-level preview
3. **Set Crop Region**: 
   - Click "Set Bottom" to define the bottom boundary
   - Click "Set Top" to define the top boundary
   - Use "Reset" to clear the selection
4. **Adjust Threshold**: Use the vertical slider to fine-tune the visualization
5. **Process**: Click "Resample" to create multiple resolution levels
   - Original resolution (cropped region only)
   - 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 resolutions for different use cases
6. **Save/Export**: 
   - "Save cropped image stack" to save only the region of interest
   - "Export 3D Model" to generate a mesh from the cropped data

### Supported File Formats
- **Input**: BMP, JPG, PNG, TIF, TIFF
- **Output**: Same as input formats
- **3D Export**: STL, PLY, OBJ

### Log File Support
CTHarvester can automatically read reconstruction settings from log files generated by CT scanning software.

## Why CTHarvester?

Traditional CT processing software often requires loading entire datasets into memory, which can be problematic for:
- Large CT scans (several GB in size)
- Computers with limited RAM (8GB or less)
- Quick preview and region selection tasks
- Batch processing of multiple datasets

CTHarvester solves these issues by:
- Using Level of Detail (LoD) for fast, memory-efficient previews
- Processing only the selected regions of interest
- Streaming data slice-by-slice instead of loading everything at once
- Creating multi-resolution outputs for different analysis needs

## Acknowledgments

- Part of the PaleoBytes software suite
- Uses the marching cubes algorithm for 3D mesh generation
- Built with Qt for cross-platform compatibility
- Designed specifically for memory-constrained environments
